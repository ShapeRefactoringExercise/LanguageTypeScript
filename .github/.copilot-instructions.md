# Copilot Instructions

## Testing Requirements
All tests must pass before making a commit unless explicitly told to do otherwise.

## Push Requirements
Push after each commit to keep the remote branch up to date.

## Commit Style Requirements
Use micro commits - make small, focused commits that represent single logical changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.

## Merge Process from defactor to main
Before merging the defactor branch to main, the following steps must be done:

1. Rename `.copilot-instructions.md` to `.defactor-copilot-instructions.md`
2. Rename `.refactor-copilot-instructions.md` to `.copilot-instructions.md`
3. Commit
4. Merge
5. Undo rename on the `defactor` branch
6. Commit
